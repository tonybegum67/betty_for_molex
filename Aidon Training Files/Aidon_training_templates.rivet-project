              ## Introduction to The Knowledge Brief


              While having a set of requirements is essential to the project, we
              also want stakeholders to understand why the change exists, why
              the needs are important, and how this information may help them so
              that they can make great decisions. Without a firm fundamental
              understanding of the "why" and "what" we are doing in a change
              project, we risk not reaching the desired result. Statistics show
              that, despite the best intentions, projects continue to fail, and
              one of the leading causes is inadequate requirements. Therefore,
              **the purpose of The Knowledge Brief is to present** **the
              structure of strategic** **and tactical steps behind the proposed
              change strategy** or action to solve a need within a business thus
              providing better clarity to all stakeholders.


              ## What do business analysts do?


              Have you ever been in a position where you were going out for the
              evening and meeting new people? Eventually, the conversation will
              turn to a professional topic, and you will mention that you are a
              "Business Analyst." This all appears harmless enough, but we all
              know that ultimately you'll be asked, **"What do business analysts
              do?"** It will be challenging and tricky to explain. This raises
              some challenges...


              - How would we communicate what we do to individuals in a
              straightforward manner?

              - How can we understand the roles ourselves?

              - How do we describe what we have done when we change jobs or
              industries?

              - How do we genuinely comprehend what we are expected to perform?

              - What does a business analyst do?

              - And why is it important?


              I believe it is critical to recognise that there is a structure
              and foundation within which we operate as business analysts. It's
              also vital to understand that it's pretty predictable and
              straightforward. As I introduce you to The Knowledge Brief, I'll
              use an **investigative journalist metaphor** to explain the role
              of a business analyst and what we do.


              ## Welcome to The Knowledge Brief


              ![The Knowledge
              Brief](https://app.dropinblog.com/uploaded/blogs/34243617/files/The_Knowledge_Brief_for_Business_Analysts.png)


              **So, what exactly is the knowledge brief? This is, for all
              intents and purposes, simply a tool.** As a result, it's not
              overly fancy or complicated. It could be described as a simplified
              business case or business requirements document template for
              business analysts. In the past, business analysts were frequently
              required to create these large documents that in many cases
              stakeholder wouldn't read. And this is a significant challenge
              because, as a business analyst, you want others to value what you
              do. So, while having a set of requirements is critical to the
              project, we also want people to understand why the project exists,
              why the requirements matter, and the value of this information.


              **The goal is to keep things as simple as possible.** And the
              reason we keep it simple is because we know we work with numerous
              stakeholders who have different information needs. We don't only
              work with one type of stakeholder. We work with C-level
              executives, end users, and customers, as well as sponsors, project
              managers, and business architects. And we collaborate with a
              diverse group of people to not only record requirements, but also
              to truly comprehend and analyse what these changes might be. So I
              wanted The Knowledge Brief to be simple but informative. As BAs,
              our intention is to present the stakeholders with clarity, not
              certainty, but clarity. And clarity is basically about ensuring
              that you have what you need to make good decisions. It's simple.
              It's self-evident.


              When we talk about requirements, we often talk about how it needs
              to be atomic, concise, clear. As a result, every aspect of The
              Knowledge Brief must be tailored to these principles. It's almost
              like completing a whole set of requirements while also doing your
              background statement and various other components in your
              Knowledge Brief, which we'll explore soon, using similar
              principles.


              As previously stated, The Knowledge Brief is merely a tool for
              condensing structured information while remaining true to the
              value of the information and delivering it to the audience in a
              specified manner. Again, you do not have to provide everything
              within The Knowledge Brief; it is up to you and the stakeholders
              to determine the depth of information. It's formatted as a
              dashboard that can be printed or used as a presentation. For
              instance, instead of a paper, we can present numerous slides or
              just one, depending on your audience.


              ## Meet your investigative journalist


              ![Investigative
              Journalist](https://app.dropinblog.com/uploaded/blogs/34243617/files/The_Knowledge_Brief_Investigative_Journalist.png)


              Now, consider yourself an **investigative journalist**, and I
              frequently say this about business analysts: what you're actually
              doing is gathering information from multiple sources,
              investigating and evaluating it, and compiling it into a package.
              And so, effectively, what you're doing here is crafting a story
              out of a collection of facts. As a result, The Knowledge Brief
              becomes your instrument for conducting research, gathering crucial
              information, and presenting your findings to your audience in a
              clear and organised manner.


              In our 12-part blog series, we will explore the tactics required
              in a change in an open, understandable manner. So you can
              experiment by putting together your own Knowledge Brief. This is
              intended to assist you as a BA; it is not intended to dictate
              exactly how you should do it, but it does help answer the
              question. **"What do business analysts do?"** The Knowledge Brief
              has the potential to spark insight into genuine business change or
              transformation, and it is always contextual. So what you're
              attempting to do here is establish context, basic understanding,
              clarity on what the project is, and conciseness so that anyone you
              talk to understands the value of the project at hand. So,
              **welcome to The Knowledge Brief.** I am delighted that you have
              viewed this brief summary (and considered the role of an
              investigative journalist) as you continue through the various
              sections of your Knowledge Brief. Happy Learning!

              You need to create a chart using the link provided, the data table
              provided and join the link with JSON code. 


              #Create a chart 


              https://quickchart.io/chart?width=500&height=300&chart={...} 



              ## Instructions

              - Use the "Category" field for the x-axis labels and lable names.

              - Map "Severity" textual descriptions to numeric values: 'High' =
              3, 'Medium' = 2, 'Low' = 1. 

              - Ensure you have 9 Categores represented and that the content
              from the table is matched

              - Use the specified colors for each severity level:
                  - High (3): #ff7077
                  - Medium (2): #fbc740
                  - Low (1): #5dd6f4

              - **Severity Mappings**:
                - High (3): #ff7077
                - Medium (2): #fbc740
                - Low (1): #5dd6f4

              ### Numeric Values for Severity:

              - High = 3

              - Medium = 2

              - Low = 1


              ### Data for the Chart:

              - **Data Points**: 
                - High: 
                - Medium: 
                - Low: 

              ### Chart URL:
