## üéØ Evaluation Metrics

### Primary Dimensions

1. **Exact Match (15% weight)**
   - Binary 0/1 scoring
   - Tests precise answer accuracy
   - Critical for classification questions

2. **Semantic Similarity (25% weight)**
   - 0-1 scale using vector similarity
   - Tests meaning equivalence
   - Threshold: ‚â•0.75 for good performance

3. **Rubric Precision (20% weight)**
   - 0-3 scale
   - Length accuracy (word count)
   - Concept precision (coverage)
   - Target: 3 = excellent, 2 = good, 1 = fair, 0 = poor

4. **Rubric Adherence (25% weight)**
   - 0-3 scale
   - OBT compliance (‚â§10 words, metric-free, What/How, present tense)
   - Most critical dimension for Betty's core competency
   - Target: ‚â•2.5 average for production

5. **Rubric Explanation (15% weight)**
   - 0-3 scale
   - Justification quality
   - Reasoning clarity
   - Evidence citation

### Composite Overall Score

```
Overall Score =
  (Exact_Match √ó 0.15) +
  (Semantic_Similarity √ó 0.25) +
  (Rubric_Precision/3 √ó 0.20) +
  (Rubric_Adherence/3 √ó 0.25) +
  (Rubric_Explanation/3 √ó 0.15)
```

**Result Range:** 0.0 - 1.0

## üìä Expected Results

### Production Readiness Criteria

Betty should achieve:

| Metric | Target | Threshold |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Overall Score | ‚â•0.85 | ‚â•0.75 |
| Rubric Adherence | ‚â•2.7 | ‚â•2.5 |

## üéì Key Test Patterns

### Pattern 1: Activity ‚Üí Outcome
**Test:** "Rewrite 'implement ERP system' as an outcome (‚â§10 words)"
**Expected:** "Business processes are integrated enterprise-wide"
**Common Errors:**
- ‚ùå "Implement ERP system by Q4" (still How + timeline)
- ‚ùå "ERP system achieves 95% adoption" (contains metric)
- ‚ùå "Deploy SAP ERP across all locations" (How verb + specifics)

### Pattern 2: What vs How Classification
**Test:** "Classify 'Decision speed improves measurably' ‚Äî What or How?"
**Expected:** "What"
**Reasoning:** Describes achieved result state, not implementation method

### Pattern 3: Acceptance Criteria Structure
**Test:** "Write acceptance criteria for 'Workforce capabilities enhanced significantly'"
**Expected Structure:**
- Owner: HR/L&D
- Measure: competency assessment pass rate
- Goal: 90% within 12 months
- Evidence: assessment reports

### Pattern 4: Maturity Assessment
**Test:** "State Part Information Management maturity (current and target)"
**Expected Format:** "Current: Level 2 (Managed), Target: Level 4 (Quantitatively Managed)"
**Key:** Must use 1-5 scale with level names, NOT percentages

### Pattern 5: Impact vs Maturity Distinction
**Critical:** Betty must NEVER confuse:
- **Maturity Levels:** 1-5 scale (Initial, Managed, Defined, Quantitatively Managed, Optimized)
- **Impact Scores:** 0-3 integers (project impact on capabilities)

## üîß Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Low Rubric Adherence (<2.0)
**Symptoms:** Betty violating OBT rules
**Check:**
1. System prompt OBT sections (lines 27-29 in betty_app.py)
2. Knowledge base has OBT methodology documents
3. Betty not adding excessive context/explanations

### Poor Semantic Similarity (<0.60)
**Symptoms:** Responses don't match expected meaning
**Check:**
1. Knowledge base accessibility (54 files loaded?)
2. Domain-specific data files present
3. System prompt domain routing (lines 230-240)

### High Error Rate (>5%)
**Symptoms:** Multiple questions failing
**Check:**
1. Streamlit app running: `ps aux | grep streamlit`
2. ChromaDB connection: Check logs for database errors
3. API connectivity: `curl http://localhost:8501/_stcore/health`

### Slow Response Times (>30s)
**Symptoms:** Timeout or very slow responses
**Check:**
1. Vector database indexing
2. Search result limit (currently 8 in settings.py)
3. Network latency to API

## üìà Next Steps

### Phase 1: Initial Evaluation (Recommended)
1. Run full 50-question evaluation
2. Generate summary report
3. Identify weak categories/domains
4. Document baseline scores

### Phase 2: Analysis & Optimization
1. Review low-scoring questions
2. Analyze rubric adherence patterns
3. Check domain-specific accuracy
4. Verify OBT compliance

### Phase 3: Iterative Improvement
1. Update system prompt if needed
2. Enhance knowledge base if gaps found
3. Adjust response templates
4. Re-run evaluation to measure improvement

### Phase 4: Continuous Monitoring
1. Integrate into CI/CD pipeline
2. Run on every system prompt change
3. Track performance trends over time
4. Maintain ‚â•0.75 overall score threshold
