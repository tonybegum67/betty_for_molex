--- Page 1 --- DISCLOSURE REGARDING REAL ESTATE AGENCY RELATIONSHIP (As required by the Civil Code) (C.A.R. Form AD, Revised 12/24) DISCLOSURE REGARDING REAL ESTATE AGENCY RELATIONSHIP (AD PAGE 1 OF 2) AD REVISED 12/24 (PAGE 1 OF 2)□ (If checked) This form is being provided in connection with a transaction for a leasehold interest exceeding one year as per Civil Code §§ 2079.13(j), (k), and (l). When you enter into a discussion with a real estate agent regarding a real estate transaction, you should from the outset understand what type of agency relationship or representation you wish to have with the agent in the transaction. SELLER’S AGENT A Seller’s agent under a listing agreement with the Seller acts as the agent for the Seller only. A Seller’s agent or a subagent of that agent has the following affirmative obligations:To the Seller: A Fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty and loyalty in dealings with the Seller.To the Buyer and the Seller: (a) Diligent exercise of reasonable skill and care in performance of the agent’s duties. (b) A duty of honest and fair dealing and good faith. (c) A duty to disclose all facts known to the agent materially affecting the value or desirability of the property that are not known to, or within the diligent attention and observation of, the parties. An agent is not obligated to reveal to either party any confidential information obtained from the other party that does not involve the affirmative duties set forth above. BUYER’S AGENT A Buyer’s agent can, with a Buyer’s consent, agree to act as agent for the Buyer only. This includes a Buyer’s agent under a buyer-broker representation agreement with the Buyer. In these situations, the agent is not the Seller’s agent, even if by agreement the agent may receive compensation for services rendered, either in full or in part from the Seller. An agent acting only for a Buyer has the following affirmative obligations:To the Buyer: A fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty and loyalty in dealings with the Buyer.To the Buyer and the Seller: (a) Diligent exercise of reasonable skill and care in performance of the agent’s duties. (b) A duty of honest and fair dealing and good faith. (c) A duty to disclose all facts known to the agent materially affecting the value or desirability of the property that are not known to, or within the diligent attention and observation of, the parties. An agent is not obligated to reveal to either party any confidential information obtained from the other party that does not involve the affirmative duties set forth above. AGENT REPRESENTING BOTH SELLER AND BUYER A real estate agent, either acting directly or through one or more salespersons and broker associates, can legally be the agent of both the Seller and the Buyer in a transaction, but only with the knowledge and consent of both the Seller and the Buyer.In a dual agency situation, the agent has the following affirmative obligations to both the Seller and the Buyer: (a) A fiduciary duty of utmost care, integrity, honesty and loyalty in the dealings with either the Seller or the Buyer. (b) Other duties to the Seller and the Buyer as stated above in their respective sections. In representing both Seller and Buyer, a dual agent may not, without the express permission of the respective party, disclose to the other party confidential information, including, but not limited to, facts relating to either the Buyer’s or Seller’s financial position, motivations, bargaining position, or other personal information that may impact price, including the Seller’s willingness to accept a price less than the listing price or the Buyer’s willingness to pay a price greater than the price offered. SELLER AND BUYER RESPONSIBILITIES Either the purchase agreement or a separate document will contain a confirmation of which agent is representing you and whether that agent is representing you exclusively in the transaction or acting as a dual agent. Please pay attention to that confirmation to make sure it accurately reflects your understanding of your agent’s role. The above duties of the agent in a real estate transaction do not relieve a Seller or Buyer from the responsibility to protect their own interests. You should carefully read all agreements to assure that they adequately express your understanding of the transaction. A real estate agent is a person qualified to advise about real estate. If legal or tax advice is desired, consult a competent professional. If you are a Buyer, you have the duty to exercise reasonable care to protect yourself, including as to those facts about the property which are known to you or within your diligent attention and observation. Both Sellers and Buyers should strongly consider obtaining tax advice from a competent professional because the federal and state tax consequences of a transaction can be complex and subject to change. Throughout your real property transaction you may receive more than one disclosure form, depending upon the number of agents assisting in the transaction. The law requires each agent with whom you have more than a casual relationship to present you with this disclosure form. You should read its contents each time it is presented to you, considering the relationship between you and the real estate agent in your specific transaction. This disclosure form includes the provisions of §§ 2079.13 to 2079.24, inclusive, of the Civil Code set forth on page 2. Read it carefully. Note: Real estate broker commissions are not set by law and are fully negotiable. I/WE ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT OF A COPY OF THIS DISCLOSURE AND THE PORTIONS OF THE CIVIL CODE PRINTED ON THE SECOND PAGE.

A listing agent and a selling agent may agree to share any compensation or commission paid, or any right to any compensation or commission for which an obligation arises as the result of a real estate transaction, and the terms of any such agreement shall not necessarily be determinative of a particular relationship.2079.20 Nothing in this article prevents an agent from selecting, as a condition of the agent’s employment, a specific form of agency relationship not specifically prohibited by this article if the requirements of § 2079.14 and § 2079.17 are complied with.2079.21 (a) A dual agent may not, without the express permission of the seller, disclose to the buyer any confidential information obtained from the seller.

Mediation fees, if any, shall be divided equally among the parties involved. If, for any dispute or claim to which this paragraph applies, any party (i) commences an action without first attempting to resolve the matter through mediation, or (ii) before commencement of an action, refuses to mediate after a request has been made, then if that party is the losing party in any such action, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover attorney’s fees from the non-mediating party, notwithstanding the terms in paragraph 10. Exclusions from the mediation agreement are specified in paragraph 12B. B. ADDITIONAL MEDIATION TERMS: The following matters are excluded from mediation: (i) a judicial or non-judicial foreclosure or other action or proceeding to enforce a deed of trust, mortgage or installment land sale contract as defined in Civil code § 2985; (ii) an unlawful detainer action; (iii) the filing or enforcement of a mechanic’s lien; and (iv) any matter that is within the jurisdiction of a probate, small claims or bankruptcy court. The filing of a court action to enable the recording of a notice of pending action for order of attachment, receivership, injunction, or other provisional remedies, shall not constitute a waiver of the mediation provisions, provided the filing party, concurrent with or immediately after such filing, makes a request to the court for a stay of litigation pending any mediation proceeding. C. ARBITRATION ADVISORY: If Buyer and Broker desire to resolve disputes arising between them through arbitration rather than court, they can document their agreement by attaching and signing an Arbitration Agreement (C.A.R. Form ARB). 13. LEGALLY AUTHORIZED SIGNER: Wherever the signature or initials of the Legally Authorized Signer, identified in the signature block below, appear on this Agreement or any related documents, it shall be deemed to be in a representative capacity for the entity described and not in an individual capacity, unless otherwise indicated. The Legally Authorized Signer (i) represents that the entity for which that person is acting already exists and is in good standing to do business in California and (ii) shall deliver to Broker, within 3 days after execution of this Agreement, evidence of authority to act in that capacity (such as but not limited to: applicable portion of the trust or Certification Of Trust (Probate Code § 18100.5), letters testamentary, court order, power of attorney, corporate resolution, or formation documents of the business entity). 14. ENTIRE AGREEMENT: All understandings between the parties are incorporated in this Agreement. Its terms are intended by the parties as a final, complete and exclusive expression of their agreement with respect to its subject matter, and may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior agreement or contemporaneous oral agreement. This Agreement may not be extended, amended, modified, altered or changed, except in writing signed by Buyer and Broker. In the event that any provision of this Agreement is held to be ineffective or invalid, the remaining provisions will nevertheless be given full force and effect.

This multiple representation can occur through an individual licensed as a broker or salesperson or through different individual broker’s or salespersons (associate licensees) acting under the Broker’s license. The associate licensees may be working out of the same or different office locations. Multiple Buyers: Broker (individually or through its associate licensees) may be working with many prospective buyers at the same time. These prospective buyers may have an interest in, and make offers on, the same properties. Some of these properties may be listed with Broker and some may not. Broker will not limit or restrict any particular buyer from making an offer on any particular property whether or not Broker represents other buyers interested in the same property. Multiple Sellers: Broker (individually or through its associate licensees) may have listings on many properties at the same time. As a result, Broker will attempt to find buyers for each of those listed properties. Some listed properties may appeal to the same prospective buyers. Some properties may attract more prospective buyers than others. Some of these prospective buyers may be represented by Broker and some may not. Broker will market all listed properties to all prospective buyers whether or not Broker has another or other listed properties that may appeal to the same prospective buyers. Dual Agency: If Seller is represented by Broker, Seller acknowledges that broker may represent prospective buyers of Seller’s property and consents to Broker acting as a dual agent for both seller and buyer in that transaction. If Buyer is represented by Broker, buyer acknowledges that Broker may represent sellers of property that Buyer is interested in acquiring and consents to Broker acting as a dual agent for both buyer and seller with regard to that property. In the event of dual agency, seller and buyer agree that: a dual agent may not, without the express permission of the respective party, disclose to the other party confidential information, including, but not limited to, facts relating to either the buyer’s or seller’s financial position, motivations, bargaining position, or other personal information that may impact price, including the seller’s willingness to accept a price less than the listing price or the buyer’s willingness to pay a price greater than the price offered; and except as set forth above, a dual agent is obligated to disclose known facts materially affecting the value or desirability of the Property to both parties. Offers not necessarily confidential: Buyer is advised that seller or listing agent may disclose the existence, terms, or conditions of buyer’s offer unless all parties and their agent have signed a written confidentiality agreement. Whether any such information is actually disclosed depends on many factors, such as current market conditions, the prevailing practice in the real estate community, the listing agent’s marketing strategy and the instructions of the seller. Buyer and seller understand that Broker may represent more than one buyer or more than one seller and even both buyer and seller on the same transaction and consents to such relationships. Seller and/or Buyer acknowledges reading and understanding this Possible Representation of More Than One Buyer or Seller - Disclosure and Consent and agrees to the agency possibilities disclosed.

Form BCA, 5/24) BROKER COMPENSATION ADVISORY (BCA PAGE 1 OF 1) CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATIONOF REALTORS ® 1. WHEN SELLERS LIST THEIR PROPERTY FOR SALE THROUGH A REAL ESTATE BROKER THEY AGREE TO PAY THE SELLER’S BROKER WHEN ESCROW CLOSES. THE SELLER MAY ALSO AUTHORIZE THE SELLER’S BROKER TO SHARE COMPENSATION WITH A BUYER’S BROKER OR MAY AGREE TO DIRECTLY PAY THE BUYER’S BROKER: A. Listing Agreement Compensation is Negotiable: When a seller enters into a listing agreement with a broker, the seller authorizes the broker to find a buyer for the seller’s property and agrees to pay the seller’s broker if a buyer is found who purchases the property. Compensation amounts are not fixed by law but are instead negotiable between the seller and the seller’s broker. When negotiating compensation, the parties may discuss factors such as the broker’s expertise and experience, the type of broker services to be performed, and the broker’s time and expenses, among other considerations. If the seller approves, a listing agreement may authorize the seller’s broker to share part of that broker’s compensation with the broker who represents the buyer, and the amount the seller’s broker agrees to pay the buyer’s broker will be incorporated into the overall compensation the seller is obligated to pay the seller’s broker. B. Offering Compensation to a Buyer’s Broker is Negotiable: Sellers and seller’s brokers are not required by law or otherwise to offer compensation to buyer’s brokers. The promise of payment from the seller’s broker to the buyer’s broker may lead to a quicker or more efficient transaction because: (1) Knowing the overall cost of broker compensation at time of listing allows a seller to more easily calculate the seller’s net proceeds when evaluating offers and counter offers; (2) The seller’s property may become more attractive to buyers who need a loan to finance the purchase price, since buyer’s broker compensation would be paid from the seller’s proceeds at the time of closing, rather than “out of pocket” by the buyer who may have limited funds. Many buyers have limited funds after paying a deposit, a down payment, property inspections costs, and other costs for closing. These buyers may be more likely to write an offer for the seller’s property if they are able to effectively finance the buyer broker compensation into the cost of their loan rather than coming up with additional funds. By making the seller’s property attractive to all buyers, regardless of their ability to directly pay a buyer’s broker, the pool of prospective buyers for the seller’s property will likely increase; (3) Offering compensation to buyer’s brokers allows the seller to inform brokers representing prospective buyers they can rely on the efficient payment of their compensation without adding to buyer’s closing costs. An offer of compensation from the seller’s broker to the buyer’s broker is optional; a seller may instruct the seller’s broker to offer no such compensation. In the listing agreement, or amendment, the seller instructs the seller’s broker whether to offer any compensation to the buyer’s brokers, and, if so, how much. 2. BUYER’S BROKERS COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS: In California, a buyer representation agreement is recommended and required in certain circumstances , which may limit the amount a buyer’s broker may be paid to the amount in the agreement. A. Buyers and their brokers benefit when the terms of their relationship and respective duties are written because expressed written terms establish mutual expectations and help avoid misunderstandings over buyer and broker duties and the amount of compensation the buyer’s agent expects to be paid. B. Many sellers authorize their brokers to offer compensation to buyer’s brokers in the listing agreement. This may be used to offset the obligation a buyer has under a buyer representation agreement. C. A buyer’s broker should communicate with the buyer about how the broker will be paid for their work in representing the buyer. D. In the absence of a buyer representation agreement, if the compensation offered to the buyer’s broker from third parties is insufficient to meet the expectations of the buyer’s broker, and the buyer’s broker is unable, prior to drafting an offer on behalf of the buyer, to reach an agreement with the seller or seller’s broker to be paid an amount the broker deems adequate, buyer’s brokers are not obligated to represent the buyer. 3. METHODS FOR BUYER’S BROKER TO OBTAIN COMPENSATION: A. Buyer Pays the Compensation through a Buyer Representation Agreement: A buyer’s broker may negotiate the amount of compensation expected directly with the Buyer who may choose to simply pay their own agent. B. Seller Pays the Compensation (1) Buyer negotiates for Seller to Pay Buyer’s Obligation under a Buyer Representation Agreement: A buyer may negotiate a term in the purchase agreement, asking the seller to pay the obligation they have already agreed to pay their own agent in a buyer representation agreement. This option should be discussed when creating a buyer representation agreement and prior to an offer being made. (2) Buyer’s Agent negotiates an agreement directly with Seller: If a seller is unrepresented or does not have an exclusive agency relationship with another agent, a buyer’s agent may approach that seller to obtain a single party compensation agreement where the seller agrees to pay the buyer’s broker compensation without necessarily creating an agency relationship. C. Seller’s Age nt Pays the Compensation to Buyer’s Agent: A seller may have authorized the seller’s broker to offer compensation to the buyer’s broker in the listing agreement. A buyer’s agent may want to inquire with a seller’s agent about whether they have such authorization. A seller’s agent and buyer’s agent can enter into a cooperating broker compensation agreement where the seller’s broker agrees to compensate the buyer’s broker. By signing below, Seller or Buyer acknowledges that they have read, understand, and have received a Copy of this Broker Compensation Advisory. Seller or Buyer acknowledges they have been advised of their various options regarding compensation to be paid to real estate brokers and that any written agreement they have signed with a seller’s or buyer’s broker reflects a mutual understanding.

G. EARTHQUAKES AND FLOODING: Susceptibility of the Property to earthquake/seismic hazards and propensity of the Property to flood. H. FIRE, HAZ ARD , AND OTHER INSURANCE: The availability and cost of necessary or desired insurance may vary. The location of the Property in a seismic, flood or fire hazard zone, and other conditions, such as the age of the Property and the claims history of the Property and Buyer, may affect the availability and need for certain types of insurance. Buyer should explore insurance options early as this information may affect other decisions, including the removal of loan and inspection contingencies. I.

REALTOR® is a registered collective membership mark which may be used only by members of the NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS® who subscribe to its Code of Ethics.The California Consumer Privacy Act (commencing with Civil Code § 1798.100) (“CCPA”), as amended by California voters in 2020, grants to California residents certain rights in their private, personal information (“PI”) that is collected by companies with whom they do business. Under the CCPA, PI is defined broadly to encompass non-public records information that could reasonably be linked directly or indirectly to you. PI could potentially include photographs of, or sales information about, your property. During the process of buying and selling real estate your PI will be collected and likely shared with others, including real estate licensees, a Multiple Listing Service, real estate internet websites, service providers, lenders, and title and escrow companies, to name several possibilities. Businesses that are covered by the CCPA are required to grant you various rights in your PI, including the right to know what PI is collected, the right to know what PI is sold or shared and to whom, the right to request that the business correct or delete your PI, the right to “opt out” or stop the transfer of your PI to others, and the right to limit the use of certain PI which is considered “sensitive.” You may get one or more notices regarding your CCPA rights from businesses you interact with in a real estate transaction. However, not all businesses that receive or share your PI are obligated to comply with the CCPA. Moreover, businesses that are otherwise covered under the CCPA may have a legal obligation to maintain PI, notwithstanding your instruction to the contrary. For instance, regardless of whether they are covered by CCPA, under California law, brokers and Multiple Listing Services are required to maintain their records for 3 years. If you wish to exercise your rights under CCPA, where applicable, you should contact the respective business directly. You can obtain more information about the CCPA and your rights under the law from the State of California Department of Justice (oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa).
